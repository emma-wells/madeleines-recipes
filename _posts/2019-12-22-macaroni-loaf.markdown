## From Grandma


Cook 3/4 cup elbow macaroni and drain. Mix in 1 1/2 cups of milk, heated enough to melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Then let it cool and beat in 4 eggs.

In a bowl, put 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs, 1 minced pimento, 2 tablespoons minced parsley, 2 tablespoons grated onion,  1 1/2 cups grated cheddar, 1/2 teasppon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon paprika. Mix in the milk and fold in the macaroni. Pour everything in a butter loaf pan (it must be glass). Bake at 325F for 60 minutes.

You can serve sliced with cheese, tomato or mushroom sauce. Use a can of soup diluted with a half-can of water.
