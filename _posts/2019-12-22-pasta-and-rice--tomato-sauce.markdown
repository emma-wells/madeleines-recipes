## from Grandma
### Inredients
* 2 pounds fresh or 2 cups canned tomatoes
* 1 medium onion
* 1/4 pound butter
* 1/4 teaspoon granulated sugar


1. Wash tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes.

2. Puree tomatoes then pour back in pot. Add butter, onion, salt and sugar. Cook 45 minutes. Discard onion.



Emma's note: This is almost exactly Marcella Hazan's '4 ingredient' pasta sauce.
