## From Grandma
### Ingredients
* 1 cup unsifted all-purpose flour
* 3 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup rolled oats, uncooked
* 1/3 cup honey
* 1 cup orange juice
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoons grated orange peel


Mix and sift flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Stir in oats. Combine orange juice, honey, egg and oil. Beat until well-blended, add with grated peel. Stir just until all dry ingredients are mixed in.* Fill well-greased muffin pans 2/3 full. Bake at 425F for 15 minutes. Makes 12 muffins.

*This batter is thinner than is usual for muffins
