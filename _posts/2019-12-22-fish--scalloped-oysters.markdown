## From Grandma


2 cups milk heated in a saucepan. Add 2 cups oysters, 2 cups cracker crumbs, and 1/4 pound butter, salt and pepper. Stir well. Put in baking dish. Bake for 3/4 hour at 325F. Serves 6. This mixture is prepared in the morning and left in the refridgerator until 1 hour before baking time. The flabor is much improved.
