## From ??

Brown 4 to 4 1/2 pounds of brisket in oil in a heavy roaster. Cut a medium onion in slices and combine with the Adalphi's Meat Marinade (1 or 2 packages may be used). Follow the instructions on the package for the amount of water.

Pour over the meat. Cover with a lid or fail. Bake at 325F for 4 hours. Baste occasionally. Slice across the grain. You may use the juice as a dip for french bread.
