## From Grandma
* 4 cups coarsely chopped peeled apples
* 1-3/4 cups sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup Crisco oil (canola)
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2 cups sifted regular flour
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts

 Preheat oven to 350F. Combine apple and sugar; set aside. In a large mixing bowl mix eggs, oil, and vanilla: then beat one minute at medium speed. Add combined dry ingredients alternately with apple mixture. Stir in walnuts. Bake in a greased and floured 13 x 9 x2- inch pan at 350F, for 45-50 minutes, until cake tests done with a toothpick. Do not underbake.


If desired, drizzle top of cooled cake with Lemon Glaze: blend 1 cup confectionary sugar, 1-1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1 tablespoon corn syrup until smooth.
