## From Grandma
### Ingredients
* tomato sauce
* 1/4 cup flour
* 1/8 teaspoon pepper
* 1 1/2 ground beef chuck
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 8 ounces of sliced mozzeella
* 1 large eggplant (1 1/2 pounds)
* 1 teaspoons seasoned salt
* 1/4 cup salad oil
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan


Make tomato sauce. Meanwhile, wash eggplant. Cut crosswise, into 1/2-inch thick slices. Combine flour, seasoned salt, and pepper; use to coat eggplant. In 2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet, saute eggplant slices, a few at a time. Set aside slices as they brown.

Sprinkle chuck with salt, and gently shape into 8 patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Broil 4 inches from the heat for 5 minutes on each side. Spoon half the tomato sauce into a 13x9x2 inch baking dish, and put in eggplant and meat. Put in remaining sauce. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and top with mozzarella. Bake uncovered for 30 minutes. Makes 8 servings.
