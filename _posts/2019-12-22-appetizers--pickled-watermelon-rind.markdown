## From Mom via Farmstead Magazine
### Ingredients
* 2 pounds watermelon rind
* 2 cups vinegar
* 1 teaspoon whole allspice
* 1 stick cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon whole cloves
* 1/2 tablespoon salt
* 1 lemon
* 2 1/2 quarts water
* 4 cups sugar


Pare outside green skin from the rind, and remove any pink portions. Use 2 pounds of prepared rind. Cut rind into small pieces, and soak overnight in a mixture of salt and 2 quarts of water. Drain, rind, wash with fresh water, and drain again. Boil rind in fresh water until tender. Combine remaining 2 cups water with remaining ingredients. Boil 5 minutes, add rind, boil rapidly until rind is clear. Pack in sterile jars, cover with boiling vinegar syrup, and seal.
