#Crab casserole
##From Grandma
###Ingredients
* 1 8-ounce package of cream cheese
* 8 ounces crabmeat 
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup mayonaise
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dry mustard
* 2 teaspoons powdered sugar
* salt and pepper
* 1/2 cup slivered almonds

<br>Soften the cream cheese, and mix in the other ingredients. Spread in a small casserole, sprinkle with nuts, and bake at 350F until bubbly. Serve on crackers</br>

<br>Note: This recipe can be served very successfully cold. Sometimes I leave the nuts off, then because crab is so expensive now, I have made this dip happily with shrimp or salmon.</br>
