#Cheesettes
##From Grandma
<br>Cut fresh bread in 1 1/2 inch cubes. Dip into egg mixture (1 tablespoon melted butter to 1 beaten egg). Roll in finely grated cheese. Place on a cookie sheet and bake in a moderate oven (375F) until cheese is melted. Serve hot with salads. These can be made quite small (1/2-1 inch cubes). Use as appetizers.</br>
