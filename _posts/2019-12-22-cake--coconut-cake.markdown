## From Mom, and Posy Patch (chatter)

* 3 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup butter or shortening
* 1 cup finally chopped coconut
* 2 cups sugar
* 4 eggs
* 1 cup milk

Sift dry ingredients. Cream shortening and sugar. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beat well after each 1. Add milk and vanilla alternately with dry ingredients to creamed mixture. Blend thoroughly.


Blend in coconut. Bake in 3 greased and lightly floured 9" round pans. Bake at 375F for 25-30 minutes.


Can be filled with rasberry jam between layers, then a fluffy white frosting. Final touch can be a topping with more shredded coconut.
