## From Mom via Charlene Murphy
* 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
* 1 stick melted butter
* 1/2 cup sugar


Mix together and press in the bottom of a dish to make a crust. Bake at 350F for 5 minutes.

Make 3 flavors of jello and chill in ice cube trays. Use 1 cup hot water and <u>1/2</u> cup cold water. Make this the day before so jello is chilled.

Heat until hot: 1 cup pineapple juice, 1/2 cup sugar, mix together 1 envelop plain gelatine, 1/4 cup water. Add this to pineapple juice when hot. Let cool.

Beat 1/2 pint all-purpose cream and add the cooled pineapple juice. Cut jello into cuves and fold into cream and pineapple mixture. Pour into graham cracker crust and top with chopped walnuts. Set in fridge at least 6 hours.
