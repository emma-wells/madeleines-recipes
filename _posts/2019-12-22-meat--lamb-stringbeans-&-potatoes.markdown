Cover bottom of a pressure cooker with olive oil. Cut up 1 small onion and fry. Salt and pepper meat. Brown meat in this also. Dilute 2 tablespoons of tomato paste in 1 cup water and add to the mix. Add string beans and cut potatoes. Add salt, pepper and oregano.

 Set pressure cooker at 10 pounds and cook 20 minutes after the jiggle begins.
