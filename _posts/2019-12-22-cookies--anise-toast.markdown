## From Ann
###Ingredients
* 3/4 cup butter <u>or</u> 1 1/4 cup Crisco oil
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 4 eggs
* 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (heaping)
* 2 tablespoons anise flavor (I use 3 tablespoons)
* 2 1/2 cups of flour, or more


Siften butter, add sugar a little at a time, using an electric hand mixer. Add eggs one at a time, flour a little at a time. Mix well and lastly add flavoring. Make 2 rolls and flatten out into a jelly roll pan. Grease pan. Preheat oven to 350F. Bake 20 minutes. 

When golden in color, slice. Put in another greased pan and toast about 5 minutes on each side at 400F.



Ann's note: Dough is sticky so use more flour for desired consistency. I use 2 large pans. Madeline: I use Crisco oil, as it gives a better taste.
