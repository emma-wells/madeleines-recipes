## From ??
##Ingredients
* 9 cups crushed blueberries
* 6 cups sugar
*
Crush berries; put a small amount in plastic wrap and hammer the berries. Combine berries with sugar and bring to a boil. Boil for 20 minutes, until the berries come off the spoon like molasses. 

In the meantime, wash and boil jars for 10 minutes (unscrew all parts). 9 cups of berries will give you 3-4 pints of jam.

Afte the berries are done, fill the jars. Put the jars with the top screwed on, and boil them for 15 minutes.

### With pectin

Do everything the same with 3 pints (4 1/2 cups) of berries crushed a small amount with 7 cups sugar. Makes about 10 1/2 pint jars.
