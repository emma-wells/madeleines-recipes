## From Grandma
### Ingredients
* 2/3 cup shortening
* 1 teaspoon lemon peel
* 2/3 cup milk
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 3 eggs
* 1 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 2 1/4 cup sifted cake flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder


Have your shortening very soft and place in a mixing bowl with all the other ingredients. Blend until it is all very smooth (scraping occasionally).</b>
