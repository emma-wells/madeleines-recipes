<br>Well in advance, soften the butter, but do not let it melt. Mix in the flour, baking power, salt and sugar into a bowl. Add lemon zest. Stir in the egg yolks and orange flower water, then incorporate the butter into the batter. </br>
<br>Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, and fold them into the batter. Brush madeleine molds with butter and fill each shell half full.</br>
