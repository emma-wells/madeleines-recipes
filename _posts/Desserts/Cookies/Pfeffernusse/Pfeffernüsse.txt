In one large mixing bowl, combine:
* 2 cups dark corn syrup
* 2 cups sugar
* 2 cups lard
* 1 cup cold black coffee
* 1 cup Four Roses (Kentucky bourbon whiskey)
* 2 teaspoons each: baking soda, baking powder, salt
* 1 teaspoon each: black pepper, nutmeg, ginger
* 1.5 teaspoons each: ground cloves, cinnamon 
<br>Blend well. Gradually add 12 cups of flour, 2 cups at a time. Work in until the dough is smooth and slightly stiffer than apple pie pastry. Chill. Pinch off teaspoon-sized pieces and roll into balls. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in preheated 350F, 15 minutes. Cool and toss in confectionary sugar. Store in a closed container.</br>
