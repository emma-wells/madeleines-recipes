## From Mom

Pour 3/4 cup scaled milk over 1 cup uncooked quick or regular rolled outs. Add 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, cool to lukewarm. Dissolve 1 package active dry yeast in 1/4 cup lukewarm water, add to cereal mixture. Stir in 2 eggs, 1 cup finely chopped dates, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 cups flour. Add more flour as needed to make a stuff dough. Turn onto lightly floured board, knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turn once to grease top.


Cover, let rise until double. Punch down, let rise 10 minutes. Shape into loaf. Brush outside with water, roll in 1/2 cup rolled oats. Let rise in greased 9x5x3" loaf pan until double. Bake at 350F until done, about 50 minutes.
