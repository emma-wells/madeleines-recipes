## From Mom

Hearty enough to use as a main dish with salad and a heavy grain bread, as well as a side dish with poached fish.

### Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups long grain brown rice
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 sliced carrots
* 1 chunked green pepper
* 8 ounces water chestnuts, sliced
* 8 ounces bamboo shoots
* 1 cup chinese cabbage, sliced
* 1/2 pound spinach, chopped
* 1 package frozen peas
* 1 cup fresh beansprouts
* 1 pound fresh tofu (bean curd), cut into chunks
* 1 tablespoon soybean paste
* Soy sauce to taste
*  Sunflower oil


Cook rice in two cups of water. While rice is cooking, saute the following ingredients in a small amount of oil; ginger, onion, pepper, chestnuts, shoots. Add cabbage and spinach. Cook slowly without water until spinach is soft. Add peas and sprouts. Cook two minutes.

Take vegetables out of the pan with a slotted spoon, and add to the rice. Add 1-1/2 tablespoons of soybean paste to frying pan. If pan is dry, add 1 tablespoon of oil. Add soybean paste to the rice mixture. Gently fold in the tofu. Season with soy sauce. If using as a main dish, you might want to add more spinach.
