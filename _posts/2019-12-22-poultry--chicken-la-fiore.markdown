## From ??
### Ingredients
1. 2 young fryers, cut up OR favorite chicken parts
2. salt and pepper
3.  1/3 cup grated permsan cheese
4. 1/2 cup finely minced parsley
5. 1 clove garlic, finely minced
6. 1 teaspoon minced thyme
7. 1/3 cup fine breadcrumbs
8. butter (optional)
9. 2 tablespoons olive oil
10. 1/3 cup water
11. 1/2 cup dry white wine


Sponge and dry chicken. In flat pan, lay chicken pieces <u>skin side down </u>, close together, but <u>not overlapping</u>, Scatter ingredients 2-7 over the chicken <u>in the order named</u>. Drizzle olive oil over all, and pour the water around the sides of the pan without getting it on the chicken. Cook <u>uncovered</u> in a 350F oven for 1/2 hour, adding very little water if necessary to keep from drying out.

 At the end of the 1/2 hour, pour in the wine at the side, as you did the water. Cover pan closely with foil, tucking it down tightly around the outside of the pan. Bake 1/2 hour longer, or until chicken is tender.</b>
When ready to serve, chicken should be golden and moist. In the bottom of the pan, there should be a little delicious little gravy - enough to spoon over fluffy rice served with the chicken.

This dish can be assembled ready for cooking in the morning and refridgerated until it is time to put in the oven. Serve with tossed salad.
