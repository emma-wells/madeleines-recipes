## From ??
### Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 cup chopped onions
* 2 cloves of garlic, chopped finely
* 1 cup long-grain rice (Uncle Ben)
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1/2 package 10-ounces chopped spinach


Sauté onions and garlic in butter until translucent. Add rice, cumin and salt, and sauté 2 minutes. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed.

Remove from heat and let stand covered, 5 minutes. Stir in spinach with a fork.

### Spinach


Thaw frozen spinach. Squeeze out most of the water from the spinach. If using above recipe, use half of the 10-ounce package. In frying pan put about 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Heat a few minutes and add spinach, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for about 3 minutes or until spinach is cooked. With fork stir cooked spinach into cooked rice.

Note: when I make this recipe, I double it. It keeps well in the refridgerator for a week. Reheat in the microwave.

Good luck and enjoy.
