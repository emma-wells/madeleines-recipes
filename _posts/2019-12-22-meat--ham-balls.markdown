### Ingredients
* 2 1/2 pounds ground cooked ham
* 1 1/4 cups old-fashioned or quick oats, uncooked

Lightly grease a large baking dish, and set aside. Combine ham, oats, milk and eggs - shape into balls. Place in baking dish.

* 3 tablespoons cornstarch (cornflour)
* 1 1/2 tablespoons prepared mustard
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
* 1 3/4 cup pineapple juice
* 1/2 cup light corn surup
* 3 tablespoons cider vinegar


Combine brown sugar, cornstarch, mustard, and cloves in a large saucepan. Add pineapple juice, corn syrup, and vinegar and stir over medium-high heat until well combined.

 Bring to a boil, stirring constantly - reduce heat and simmer 3 minutes. Pour sauce over ham balls. Bake 1 hour at 350F.
