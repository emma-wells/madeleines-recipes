## From Grandma

Begin with the versatile complete pancake mix. Combine 1 3/4 cup complete pancake mix with 1/2 cup quick or old fashioned oats (uncooked) and 1/2 cup dark seedless raisins in a mixing bowl. Add 1 beaten egg, 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup honey and 2 tablespoons of melted or liquid shortening. Stir only until combined.

Fill 12 greased muffin cups until 3/4 full. Bake at 425F for 15-20 minutes. Serve warm.
