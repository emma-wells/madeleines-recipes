## From ??
### Oatmeal mixture
* 1 1/3 cups oatmeal
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 1/3 cup flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda


Mix together (sift flour) and add 1/2 cup butter, or favorite shortening (I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup lard or Spry).

### Filling
* 1/2 cup sugar - brown or white
* 1 package of dates, cut in pieces
* 1 tablespoon flour
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon salt


Cook until thick, being careful not to let it burn.

 Divide oatmeal mixture into 2 parts. Press firmly half of the mixture into lightly-greased tin. Carefull spread the filling, and then add the rest of the oatmeal mixture pressing it down as much as possible without the filling soaking through.

Bake in a moderate oven until crust is brown. Cut in squares when cold
