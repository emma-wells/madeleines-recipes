## From Grandma??

 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of hamburg (mixture of beef and prok). Add lots of bread that has been soaked in water. Add salt, pepper, chopped celery, 2 eggs, and a pinch of Bell Seasoning.

Chop 1 large onion or several small ones and cook in 1/2 stick of Oleo (butter or margarine). After onion is browned, add to the above mixture.

Boil liver and gizzards of turkey. Cut up into tiny pieces and add to the mixture if desired. Good for a 12-13 pound turkey.

Note: If you stuff your bird, brown your meat first and then add the ingredients.
