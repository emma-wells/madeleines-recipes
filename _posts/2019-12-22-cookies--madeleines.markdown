## From Grandma
### Ingredients
* 4 ounces unsalted butter
* 2/3 cup sugar
* grated zest from 1/2 lemon
* 2 eggs, separated
* 1 cup flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 pinch of salt
* 2 teaspoons orange flower water


Well in advance, soften the butter, but do not let it melt. Mix in the flour, baking power, salt and sugar into a bowl. Add lemon zest. Stir in the egg yolks and orange flower water, then incorporate the butter into the batter. 


Whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks, and fold them into the batter. Brush madeleine molds with butter and fill each shell half full.


Bake at 450F for 15 minutes.
