## From Grandma
* 1 cup butter
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 cup nuts, chopped fine

Line a cookie sheet with graham crackers. In a heavy saucepan, boil sugar and butter 2 minutes. Very quickly spread mixture over crackers.


Sprinkle nuts on top. Bake in 400F oven for 5 minutes. Take from oven and cut into strips immediately. Let cool and remove.
