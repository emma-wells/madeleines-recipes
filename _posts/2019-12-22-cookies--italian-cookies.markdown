## From Grandma
### Ingredients
* 6 cups sifted flour
* 1 cup melted crisco
* 1 cup milk
* 4 teaspoons lemon extract
* 11 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 cup sugar
* 6 eggs 


Beat eggs, sugar and extract until light, then add melted Crisco - beat 1 minute. Put flour in large mixing bowl - make a well, then add milk and mix well. 

Add egg mixture and beat with a wooden spoon. Dough should be a little sticky and form a ball which should yield 6 or 7 balls the size of a pie crust. Roll out between paper the same as making a pie crust about 1/4 inch thick. Bake 350F for 20 minutes.

### Filling

Spread with jelly (apricot), sprinkle with raises, dates and nuts (cinnamon if you wish) and roll (4 rolls).



Frost lightly when cooled; confectionary sugar, milk, lemon extract.
