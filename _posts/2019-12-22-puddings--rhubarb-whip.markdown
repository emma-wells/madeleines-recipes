## From Mom
###Ingredients
* 8 cups cut up rhubarb
* 1 cup water
* 2/3 cup sugar
* 1 envelope unflavored gelatine
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 egg whites at room temperature

In a large saucepan, bring rhubarb and water to a boil. Cover, then simmer until soft (about 10 minutes). Press rhubarb throgh a colander over a bowl. This should make about 2 cups of liquid and puree.

In a small saucepan, mix pureed rhubarb, sugar, gelatin and salt. Stir over low heat until gelatine is dissolved; stir in vanilla.

 Chill until slightly thickened. In a large bowl of a mixer, beat rhubarb mixture and egg whites at high speed until very light and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes.

Put in a serving dish and chill until set. Makes 6 servings.
