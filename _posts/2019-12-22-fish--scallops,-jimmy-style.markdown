## From Mom, via Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant
### Ingredients
* 2 pounds scallops
* Sherry
* 2 tablespoon dry breadcrumbs
* pinch of salt and garlic salt
* Butter
* Fresh lemon


Slice large scallops horizontally through the center to cut the cooking time in half. Arrange scallops on an oven-proof platter, containing a little melted butter. 

Make a topping of breadcrumbs, salt, garlic salt and sprinkle over scallops. Pour on a little melted butter. Place under broiler 7-10 minutes until golden-brown. Turn off broiler but let scallops heat through 3 minutes longer. Pour on a few drops of of sherry. Serve very hot with fresh lemon.
