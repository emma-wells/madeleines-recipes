## From Grandma
### Ingredients

* 1 cup onion, chopped
* 1 package of elbow macaroni (7 ounces)
* 1 can celery soup
* 2/3 cup milk
* 1 cup grated cheddar cheese
* 3 eggs, slightly beaten
* 1/2 cup crushed cornflakes


Brown sausage and onion. Pour off drippings. Cook macaroni in boiling water. Drain. Mix celery soup and milk. Bring mixture to the boiling point and remove from heat. Stir in the cheese, eggs and macaroni.

Arrange half of the sausage and onion in an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish. Pour macaroni mixture over meat. Cover with remaining sausage and sprinkle with corn flakes. Bake at 350F for 40 minutes.
