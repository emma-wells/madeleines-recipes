## From Mom via Chat

Chill 1 1/2 cups purple prune plums. Dissolve 3 ounces rasberry gelatin with 1/2 teaspoon salt in 1 cup boiling water. Add 1/4 cup cold water, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 1 cup sour cream.

Pour into a bowl and whip until fluffy. Fold in plum slices, 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Pour into a lightly oiled 1 quarter mold. Chill until set.

### Lemon honey dressing

In a small bowl whisk 1 egg with a fork until white and yolk are blended. Add 1/2 cup salad oil; beat until creamy. Blend in 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 2 tablespoons honey, and 1/4 teaspoons salt. Whip 1/2 cup whipping cream until stiff. Add to the dressing and serve in centre of a ring with chopped pecans, if desired.
