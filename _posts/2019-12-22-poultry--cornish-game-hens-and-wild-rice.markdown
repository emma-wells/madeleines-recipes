## From Grandma

Saute 3 tablespoons each of celery, onions, carrots and butter. Add 3 to 4 cups of cooked rice, and 1/2 cup chicken broth. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. When almost tender, stir in sauteed mushrooms and continue cooking until the liquid evaporates. 

Beat one egg and 1/3 cup of swiss cheese into 3 cups of the rice. Split hens and broil skin-up for 7 minutes. Saute homemade-type white bread in butter. Place in the roasting pan and mound 1/3 cup of stuffing on each. Cover with game-hen half. Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons of swiss cheese mixture over each, and baste with the resered broiling juices. Bake at 375F until tender.
