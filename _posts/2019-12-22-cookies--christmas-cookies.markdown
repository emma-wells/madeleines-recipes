## From Grandma

Melt together a small package of chocolate chips (or 4 squares of chocolate) and 4 tablespoons of butter. Cool chocolate and add 2 slightly beaten eggs. Then add:


* 1 cup crushed Arrowroot cookies
* 1 cup ground walnuts
* 1 cup confectionary sugar
* 1 package minuature colored marshmallows


Roll mixture into 4 rolls, each the diameter of a $0.50 piece. Put on wax paper and roll in coconut. Then chill and later cut into approximately 1/4 inch slices.
