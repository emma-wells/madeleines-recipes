Beat together egg yolks and salt in a large mixing bowl, slowly adding 1.5 C of sugar/  Continue beating until thick and pale.  Stir in the bourbon, rum, milk, and vanilla until well mixed.  Beat the egg whites until foamy and slowly add the remaining 3/4C sugar, continuing to beat until stiff and all the sugar has been incorporated.  Whip the cream until stiff.  Now fold the egg shites in to the yolk mixture and then fold in the whipped cream.   Pour into punch bowl and sprinkle with nutmeg.



Note from Mom: We have never used bourbon.  Kahlua is very nice.
