Dear Mom,

Here are all the recipes from Grandma’s recipe box, from the 1960s until around 2010. It turns out that I come from a line of women who know how to put cake on the table (47 cakes, 43 cookies, 26 pies and 21 puddings, 10 cobblers and 2 muffins, to be exact). 

This project started as a quest to find a cranberry relish recipe, but ended up as a rediscovery of  memories. I can remember blueberry pies. Tapioca pudding. Fig squares squished in wax paper. Coolwhip on everything. Sitting at the Kid's Table at Thanksgiving, eating eggnog sauce. Whenever I'm sad or stressed, I still eat the orange Kraft macaroni and cheese Grandma made - it always takes me back to the safety of her kitchen. I can remember exactly how Grandma's house smelled, and how loudly the screen door slammed. I hope these recipes can evoke these and many more memories for you , too.

It turns out a lot of these recipe cards are in your handwriting. To me, they are part of the story of you and Grandma. No matter where you lived, you were both thinking of each other, and making sure you both got to experience the same excitement of rhubarb crisp, pineapple date bread, or ginger crackles. 

These recipes are not just Grandma's legacy to me, but yours too.  Recipes I thought were yours, I've discovered again; this time in Grandma's handwriting. I’m so proud I owe my love of sweet things (and the ability to find 721 ways to fulfil it) to both of you.  Here’s to its next generation; I hope we can find ways to continue its legacy, 

I love you.
Emma
