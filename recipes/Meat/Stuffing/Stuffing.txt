#Stuffing
##From Grandma??
<br> 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of hamburg (mixture of beef and prok). Add lots of bread that has been soaked in water. Add salt, pepper, chopped celery, 2 eggs, and a pinch of Bell Seasoning.</br><br>Chop 1 large onion or several small ones and cook in 1/2 stick of Oleo (butter or margarine). After onion is browned, add to the above mixture.</br><br>Boil liver and gizzards of turkey. Cut up into tiny pieces and add to the mixture if desired. Good for a 12-13 pound turkey.<br><br>Note: If you stuff your bird, brown your meat first and then add the ingredients.
