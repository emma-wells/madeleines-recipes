#Mustard coating for lamb
##From Grandma
###Ingredients
* 1/2 cup strong Dijon-type mustard
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 clove mashed garlic
* 1 teaspoon rosemary or thyme
* 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil

<br>Blend the mustard, soy sauce, garlic, and herbs in a small bowl. Then beat in the oil by droplets and make a mayonnaise-like cream. Using a rubber spatula, paint the lamb with mustard mixture and set on a rack in a roasting pan. Lamb will pick up more flavor if coated several hours before roasting.</br>
