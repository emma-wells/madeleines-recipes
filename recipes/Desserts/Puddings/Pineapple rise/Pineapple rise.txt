###Ingredients
* 1 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 3/4 ounce gelatine
* 6 eggs
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, whipped

<br>Drain and grind or puree pineapple. Add half sugar. Remove 1 cup of puree and sprinkle gelatine over the top of it to soften it. Combine just egg yolks and rest of sugar and cook over low heat in a double boiler. Stir until mixture thickens. Add the mixture and stir until the gelatine dissolves. Cool to lukewarm and add remaining puree. </br><br>Whip egg whites and salt in a bowl until foamy. Fold in whipped cream. Gently fold in pineapple mixture. Pour into a mold or oblong pan. Chill until firm, about 2 hours. Garnish with whipped cream and strawberries. Serves 10-12.</br>
